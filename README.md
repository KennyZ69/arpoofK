# ARPOOF & DNSPOOF LIBRARY

- This is a go library made for easier spoofing on a network either on arp or dns level
- I wanted to make it possible that the victim machine would be redirected to some attackers web but It seems I am unable to do that
- Either way this works for me now and for my current projects
